# comparedirectory
Compare the file in on directory with the files in a second directory. I made this program to help me sort through redundant backups. Sometimes I want to make sure I don't delete something on accident (very easy for me to do). I appreciate any feedback!!

Run the exe if you are using a Windows system, and compile it from source if you are using Lunix.

Enter the two directory paths which you would like to compare, and you will have a few options of how to display a list of files.

I haven't made many original projects, and I majored in Finance; so, I know this project is probably bad.
My novice programming mind is open to ideas and critques!

I love free and open source software, and I want to infiltrate the business world, which Microsoft dominates. 

This is my Overture.
